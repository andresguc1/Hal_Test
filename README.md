## ⚡ Quick Start

1. Clone both repositories (frontend + backend)
2. Start the backend: `cd hal-test_Backend && npm start`
3. Start the frontend: `cd hal_test && npm run dev`
4. Open http://localhost:5173

## 📦 Related Repositories

### 🔗 HalTest Backend

This frontend works together with the HalTest Backend, available here:

➡️ **Repository:** https://github.com/andresguc1/hal-test_Backend

The backend exposes RESTful endpoints for browser automation, action execution, session handling, Playwright control, and more. Make sure you have it running for full functionality.

## 🚀 Features

### 🎨 **Visual Flow Builder**

- Interactive drag-and-drop interface powered by React Flow
- Easily create complex automation flows
- Real-time editing of nodes, edges, and parameters

### 🧩 **Node & Action Management**

- Node types automatically aligned with backend actions (retrieved from `/routes`)
- Dynamic configuration panels based on backend **Joi schemas**
- Parameter validation before triggering an execution

### 🖥️ **Flow Execution Engine**

- Execute entire flows by sending sequential REST calls to the backend:
  - Each node corresponds to: `/actions/:actionName`
  - Node parameters are sent in the request body
- Real-time progress tracking for each action
- Error handling, logging, and execution reports

### 📁 **Import / Export**

- Export flows to JSON for reuse or sharing
- Import previously saved flows at any time

### 🗺️ **Navigation & Tools**

- Built-in minimap for large flows
- Collapsible side panels for a clean workspace
- Optional dark mode (if added later)

### 🔌 **Full Integration With HalTest Backend**

Supports all backend features, including:

- Browser launch & control
- Navigation
- DOM interactions
- Wait conditions
- Screenshots & DOM captures
- Session & context management
- Network mocking & interception
- AI-based actions
- CI-oriented test flows

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18.x
- npm or yarn
- [HalTest Backend](https://github.com/andresguc1/hal-test_Backend) running

---

## 📦 Installation

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd hal_test
npm install
```

---

## 🏃‍♂️ Usage

### Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open: http://localhost:5173

### Production Build

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

---

## 🔌 Backend Configuration

1. Ensure the HalTest Backend is running (default: `http://localhost:3000`)

2. Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

3. The app will automatically connect to the backend on startup.

### Testing the Connection

The app will display a connection status indicator in the top bar.

### API Client Configuration

Use it in your API client:

```javascript
const api = axios.create({
  baseURL: import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL,
});
```

## 🧠 How Flow Execution Works

Each flow node represents an automation action:

```json
{
  "id": "1",
  "type": "actionNode",
  "data": {
    "action": "open_url",
    "params": { "url": "https://example.com" }
  }
}
```

The frontend sends:

```http
POST {API_URL}/actions/open_url
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "url": "https://example.com"
}
```

The backend executes it using Playwright and returns:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "result": "Page loaded"
}
```

By connecting nodes, you can visually build complete browser automation pipelines.

## 📝 Example Flow

Here's a simple flow that navigates to a website and takes a screenshot:

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "1",
      "type": "actionNode",
      "data": {
        "action": "launch_browser",
        "params": { "headless": false }
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "2",
      "type": "actionNode",
      "data": {
        "action": "open_url",
        "params": { "url": "https://example.com" }
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "3",
      "type": "actionNode",
      "data": {
        "action": "capture_screenshot",
        "params": { "path": "./screenshot.png" }
      }
    }
  ],
  "edges": [
    { "id": "e1-2", "source": "1", "target": "2" },
    { "id": "e2-3", "source": "2", "target": "3" }
  ]
}
```
